# Customer Churn Prediction & Analysis (using Python,Machine Learning and Power BI)
## üîç Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior data to identify factors that contribute to churn (i.e., customers leaving a service) and building a machine learning model to predict churn. It includes:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature engineering
- Predictive modeling using classification algorithms
- Interpretation of key drivers of churn
---
## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze customer churn patterns and predict churn using machine learning. A Random Forest Classifier was built with 69% accuracy, and Power BI dashboards were developed to visualize key trends. This helps businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategie##s.

## Questions (KPIs):
- What is the total number of customers? 
- What is the overall churn rate (%) among customers? 
- What is the customer retention rate (%)?
- What is the average customer tenure (in months)? 
- What is the average internet usage (GB) of customers? 
- How does the contract type (multi-year, yearly, monthly) impact customer churn?
- What are the preferred payment methods among churned customers? 
- How does the churn rate (%) differ by gender? 
- What is the overall churn rate (%) among customers? 
- How does the churn rate (%) vary based on subscription length (months)? 
- How does the churn rate (%) differ by gender? 
- How does internet usage (GB),customer impact churn rates?

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Model

A Random Forest classifier was used to predict churn. The model was trained on encoded customer data and evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## üìå Key Findings

- Customers with shorter subscriptions and lower internet usage are more likely to churn.
- Gender, call duration, and payment method also influence churn.
- Random Forest outperformed other models with the best prediction metrics.

---

## Project Insights:
- Analyzed 90,000+ customer records to identify key factors influencing churn.
- Built a Random Forest Classifier with 69% accuracy to predict customer churn.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn).

---

## Conclusion:
The Customer Churn Analysis revealed key factors influencing churn, such as contract type, payment method, and subscription length. By analyzing 90,000+ records, a Random Forest model     achieved 69% accuracy in predicting churn. Power BI dashboards provided insights into trends across demographics, helping businesses identify at-risk customers. The findings highlight the importance of data-driven strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn.
